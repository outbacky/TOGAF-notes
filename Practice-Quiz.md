---

- D) Phase H — Architecture Change Management

---

### Q2 — True / False

**True or False: Requirements Management is a standalone ADM phase that sits between Phase D and Phase E.**

---

### Q3 — Multiple Choice

**An architect has identified that a new government regulation requires a complete redesign of the organisation's data handling practices, touching every architecture domain. Which change type best describes this?**

- C) Large Incremental Change
- D) RE-Architecture

---

### Q4 — Multiple Choice

**Which of the following correctly describes the difference between an ABB and an SBB?**

- A) An ABB is organisation-specific; an SBB is generic and reusable
- B) An ABB defines *what* is needed (logical); an SBB defines *how* it is built (physical)
- C) An ABB is produced in Phase E; an SBB is produced in Phase A
- D) An ABB and an SBB are two names for the same concept

---

### Q5 — True / False

**True or False: In TOGAF, security architecture is treated as a separate, optional phase that organisations can add after Phase D if required.**

---

### Q6 — Multiple Choice

**A team is evaluating candidate Solution Building Blocks to confirm they can work together before committing to a migration plan. Which ADM phase are they in?**

- A) Phase B — Business Architecture
- B) Phase D — Technology Architecture
- C) Phase E — Opportunities & Solutions
- D) Phase F — Migration Planning

---

### Q7 — Multiple Choice

**An organisation wants to move from its current architecture to a target state over three years. Rather than attempting the full transformation at once, they define three intermediate states — each delivering a complete BDAT slice. What is the correct TOGAF term for these intermediate states?**

- A) Solution Building Blocks
- B) Transition Architectures
- C) Architecture Requirement Specifications
- D) Work Packages

---

### Q8 — True / False

**True or False: TOGAF's Agile/Iterative delivery approach is best suited to large infrastructure projects such as building a new airport, due to the high frequency of change involved.**

---

### Q9 — Multiple Choice

**The Enterprise Continuum classifies building blocks on a spectrum. Which of the following represents the correct order from most generic to most specific?**

- A) Organisation-Specific → Industry → System → Common → Foundation
- B) Foundation → Common → System → Industry → Organisation-Specific
- C) Industry → Foundation → Organisation-Specific → Common → System
- D) Common → Foundation → Industry → System → Organisation-Specific

---

### Q10 — Multiple Choice

**A Business Scenario in TOGAF is primarily used to:**

- A) Select the appropriate Solution Building Blocks for Phase E
- B) Translate stakeholder concerns and drivers into architecture requirements across all five domains
- C) Document the completed architecture in the Architecture Definition Document
- D) Plan the sequence of Transition Architectures for the Implementation & Migration Plan

### A1 — C) Phase P — Preliminary

The Preliminary phase is nicknamed "Setting up the Shop." It is where the organisation establishes its EA capability — defining principles, governance frameworks, and the tools and methods the architecture team will use before any architecture work begins. It is not Phase A; Phase A is where the first Architecture Vision is developed.

**Reference:** Section 2 — The ADM Cycle

---

### A2 — False

Requirements Management is **not** a standalone phase with a fixed position in the cycle. It sits at the **centre of the ADM wheel** and connects to every other phase simultaneously. It is a continuous process — not a phase — ensuring that all architecture decisions can be traced back to real, documented business requirements throughout the entire ADM cycle.

**Reference:** Section 2 — The ADM Cycle

---

### A3 — D) RE-Architecture

A regulatory change that forces a complete redesign across all architecture domains is a **RE-Architecture** change — the most significant change type. It typically requires re-entering the ADM from Phase A (Architecture Vision) or even back to the Preliminary phase to revisit the organisation's principles and governance. A Large Incremental Change would involve rework across more than one phase, but would not require starting the whole cycle over.

**Reference:** Section 2 — Reiteration & Change Types

---

### A4 — B) An ABB defines *what* is needed (logical); an SBB defines *how* it is built (physical)

This is the fundamental distinction. An **Architecture Building Block (ABB)** is logical and conceptual — it describes a capability or requirement without prescribing a specific product. An **Solution Building Block (SBB)** is the physical realisation — the actual product, system, or technology chosen to fulfil the ABB. The same ABB can be fulfilled by different SBBs in different contexts, keeping the architecture vendor-neutral at the design stage.

**Reference:** Section 5 — Architecture Building Blocks

---

### A5 — False

Security architecture in TOGAF is **not an optional add-on phase**. It is a **parallel, continuous track** that runs alongside all ADM phases from A through H. At every phase, the security architect considers the security implications of design decisions, maintains the Architecture Risks Catalogue and Risks Register, and ensures compliance with frameworks such as ISM, ERM, and ASCM.

**Reference:** Section 12 — Enterprise Security Architecture

---

### A6 — C) Phase E — Opportunities & Solutions

Phase E is the **analytical** phase where candidate SBBs are identified, interoperability is checked, and conflicts or shared service opportunities are surfaced. Only once the right solutions have been selected does the team move to Phase F (Migration Planning), where the roadmap and Implementation & Migration Plan are created. Jumping straight to Phase F risks committing to a plan built on incompatible components.

**Reference:** Section 9 — Phase E vs. Phase F Objectives

---

### A7 — B) Transition Architectures

**Transition Architectures** (T1, T2, T3…) are intermediate target states that bridge the gap between the Baseline Architecture and the full Target Architecture. Each Transition Architecture must be a coherent, deployable state in its own right — delivering a complete slice across all four BDAT domains simultaneously. They are planned in Phase F and governed in Phase G.

**Reference:** Section 10 — Transition Architecture Planning

---

### A8 — False

Large infrastructure projects like building an airport are characterised by a **high degree of change but low frequency of delivery** — placing them in the top-left quadrant of the decision matrix, which favours a **Predictive** approach, not Agile. The Agile/Iterative approach is best suited to software-intensive environments with **high frequency of delivery and high degree of change**, such as CI/CD software development pipelines.

**Reference:** Section 11 — Agile EA vs. Traditional EA

---

### A9 — B) Foundation → Common → System → Industry → Organisation-Specific

The Enterprise Continuum runs from the most **generic** (Foundation Architecture — applicable to any organisation anywhere) through to the most **specific** (Organisation-Specific Architecture — custom-built for a single enterprise). The principle is to reuse blocks from the left of the spectrum before investing in the custom work required at the right. Checking Foundation and Common blocks first saves significant time and cost.

**Reference:** Section 13 — Repository & Enterprise Continuum

---

### A10 — B) Translate stakeholder concerns and drivers into architecture requirements across all five domains

A **Business Scenario** is a structured collaborative exercise between the Architecture Team and business stakeholders. Its purpose is to uncover the real drivers and constraints behind a request — before design decisions are made — and to produce requirements across all five domains: Business, Data, Application, Technology, and Security. These requirements flow into the Architecture Requirement Specifications (A.R.S.) that govern the rest of the ADM cycle.

**Reference:** Section 14 — Business Scenarios
